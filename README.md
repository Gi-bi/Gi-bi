# Hi, I'm Jessica Grubbs 👋 (@Gi-bi)

I am an **operations manager, data analyst, and U.S. Coast Guard veteran** with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights. With a Master of Science in Information Management from the University of Washington and a strong foundation in digital technology and business, I specialize in data engineering, cloud-based solutions, and predictive analytics. My professional journey blends technical rigor with strategic leadership—helping organizations make smarter, data-driven decisions while optimizing processes and operations.

I have hands-on experience in **SQL, Python, R, and JavaScript**, with a primary focus on **data modeling and analysis in Jupyter Notebooks**. My work spans **machine learning (LSTM, regression, classification)**, **statistical modeling**, and **data visualization**, with a focus on building scalable solutions that address real-world business challenges. I also bring experience in **project management, agile methodology, and business process analysis**, enabling me to bridge the gap between technical and operational teams effectively.

Beyond my technical skills, I am deeply motivated by problem-solving and continuous learning. I thrive on tackling complex datasets, uncovering patterns, and applying them to strategic initiatives. Whether it’s optimizing database performance, building predictive models, or designing notebooks that communicate complex insights clearly, I love turning data into actionable results.

As a former U.S. Coast Guard Electrician’s Mate, I learned discipline, precision, and the importance of teamwork under high-pressure situations—skills I carry into every professional setting. I now channel that experience into leading projects, coordinating cross-functional teams, and driving operational excellence in both technical and organizational contexts.

### What I’m Working On
- Exploring advanced **data engineering pipelines** and **cloud-based solutions**.
- Building predictive models and machine learning applications for real-world datasets.
- Experimenting with interactive **Jupyter Notebook–based analyses** to communicate complex insights effectively.
